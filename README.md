# CONTROLS #
# - Left & Right arrow keys to move
# - Up arrow key to jump
# - Space bar to shoot bullets
# NOTE: - The goblin is controlled by AI (automatically) #
#       - To prevent spamming of Space bar, you can only shoot bullets in bursts of 5 #

# RULES #
# 1. Scoring: Every time your bullets hit the goblin you score [+1]
#             Every time you are punched by the goblin you are defeated and lose points [-10]
# 2. Do NOT cheat (e.g. staying in the 'safe zones' on the left or right edges of the screen)
